          The next career step was taken in the automotive industry. We worked with small systems
          and tools that increase the level of comfort of car use. The work consisted of collecting
          finished products. It was very important not to miss any trifles. Here I managed to
          sharpen my attention.

          The beginning of my official career falls on this international company in the field of
          logistics and as well as small production. I was part of the packaging team product in
          different types of wrappers. This place taught me how to be productive and at the same
          time work in a team.
